## Usage
1. Start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image (if not already built) and start the containers based on the configuration specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

4. Access the application:

   Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Puppeteer application by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8282).

   You should see the output of your Puppeteer application or any other defined behavior.
